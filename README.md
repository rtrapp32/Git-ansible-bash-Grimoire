🛠️ Git, Bash & Ansible – Session 2

Welcome to Session 2 of the Lunch & Learn series!

This Obsidian vault holds the notes, labs, and visual rituals from a practical (and slightly enchanted) introduction to Git, Bash scripting, and Ansible — three of the most useful tools for any engineer navigating the wilds of Linux automation.

> *"There is no truth in flesh, only betrayal." – Every engineer debugging a Bash script last touched in 2019.*

If you’ve ever felt unsure in the terminal, fumbled through Git commands like incantations, or wondered how to make 30 servers obey without SSH-ing into each one… this is for you.

📘 What’s in This Vault?

* `GIT, BASH, AND ANSIBLE SESSION 2.md` — the full session guide, covering:

  * **Git** as practical version control (and yes, occasionally timeline surgery)
  * **Bash** as a simple but mighty way to automate anything repeatable or at least anything annoying
  * **Ansible** as clean, readable automation across fleets  like writing a spellbook that actually works

* 🖼️ Embedded visual aids from the live session (ready for Obsidian use)

* 🔮 Future sessions will build on these foundations ( still no YAML demons ...probably)

✨ Why This Exists

Too many engineers learn Git by accident, fear Bash, and treat Ansible like it’s dark magic.
This series is here to fix that to offer clear, hands-on patterns and explanations that make these tools feel like allies, not traps.

It’s the guide I wish I had when I started. I hope it gives you the confidence to script boldly, version fearlessly, and automate like a well-fed daemon.

🧭 What’s Coming Next?

* **Session 3**: Linux PrivEsc
  *A crash course in power, paranoia, and privilege escalation.*

* **Session 4**: Database & SQL Basics
  *Decode the sacred scrolls of structured data, and survive your first join.*

* **Session 5: ???**
  Could be cursed. Could be fun. Probably both.
